Hi.

This is some advice for people looking to port Steamband.

I have not had time to update the makefiles! Please, if you compile for a non-windows environment, please send your makefiles to valis@oook.cz

These are the files you should have to add.
classpower.c
level.c
mspells1.c
mutation.c
pet.c
spells3.c
effects.c

If you _do_ compile for another system, please email me the makefile at valis@oook.cz. Also, if you could upload your compile to thangorodrim (if there hasn't been a copy of your systems compile already uploaded), and email me to 
let me know, so I can post a copy of your compile on my web page. :-)

I can't tell everyone how much I appreciate all the help that has been given to me with this project. And how thankful I am for everyone's continued patience as I learn C. 

Good luck.
-Campbell
