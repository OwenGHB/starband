# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/monster.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/monster.raw" file.
# (Monster Types)
# Currently, unique monsters are special monster races, with the require-
# ment that only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it
# is killed, it can never again be generated. Player ghosts are uniques
# whose attributes change according to data in bones files and which only
# appear once in a game.
# (Monster Symbols)
# Monsters may use most basic symbols, including all the alphabetic
# characters. They may not use: "`" (reserved as an "alternate" open door
# picture, since the "'"symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts
# (esp. IBM).
# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown

# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown


# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (almost oblivious of
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, maximum mana, and exper-
# ience for killing.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero. The first line also contains
# the monster spellpower  damage its attack spells do).

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

D:(pronounced HAD-roh-SAWR-us) Hadrosaurus (meaning "bulky

D: 10 m) long ornithischian from the late Cretaceous period.
D: Hadrosaurus was discovered by W. P. Foulke and excavated and
D: named by anatomist J. Leidy in 1858 from a skull-less skeleton
D: and hundreds of teeth found in New Jersey. It was the first
D: American dinosaur to be described and the first nearly-complete
D: dinosaur skeleton. Although the Hadrosaurids are named for this
D: genus, Hadrosaurus is a doubtful genus because there is so little

D:"First of all impressions was its enormous size; the

D: perceived that its gigantic, flabby body lay along the ground, and
D: that its skin was of a corrugated white, dappling into blackness
D: along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing. I think also
D: that we saw then the profile at least of the almost brainless head,
D: with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth,
D: its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf invariably
D: shuts its eyes in the presence of the sun.) We had a glimpse of a
D: vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we
D: had a breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over like

D:"His height was considerably below the average, his

D: endeavor to realize what the complexion of a corpse

D: some dim notion of the idea I am trying to convey. His
D: eyes were small, deeply sunken, and in repose apparently

D: machinery in active movement. . . .And not only did the

D: The meaning and structure of this huge apparatus we saw I cannot explain,
D: because we neither of us learnt what it was for or how it worked.
D: One after another, big shafts of metal flung out and up from its centre,
D: their heads travelling in what seemed to me to be a parabolic path;
D: each dropped a sort of dangling arm as it rose towards the
D: apex of its flight and plunged down into a vertical cylinder, forcing this
D: down before it. . . As each of the three dangling arms of the

D: of the top of the vertical cylinder came pouring this
D: incandescent substance that lit the place, and ran over as milk runs over a

D: Great Bandit (1794). His real name is Neapolitan Count Rosalvo,
D: who desires to rid Venice of all assassins, thugs, and conspirators.
D: He takes two different identies to accomplish this task. Flodoardo
D: virtuous and handsome -- and Aballino, a gigantic terrifying outlaw
D: with a horrifying visage. Aballino is told to kill Rosabella,
D: his love, the niece of the Doge, to prove his worth to a
D: underworld gang of thugs. Instead of killing her he kisses her.
D: The Doge then hires Flodardo with the promise that he can have
D: Rosabella's hand in marriage if he captures Aballino.
D: The Count does so. He calls all the outlaws together, and allows
D: himself to be captured along with all of them -- only to reveal himself
D: as Flodardo.

D:Mary Shelley wrote about Victor and his monster (1818). "His limbs were

D: Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work
D: of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,
D: and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
D: only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed
D: almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were
D: set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips." Eloquent, and
D: well educated, the monster demands that Victor make him a bride to give
D: him a place in the world, or he will kill everyone that Victor
D: knows. Victor returns and attempts this, but is overcome with
D: guilt with evil that he has already committed and cannot finish.
D: He destroys this new monstrosity and flees to meet his fiancee.
D: On his way he hears her dying scream as the monster kills her.

D:The Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus) was a species of bear which lived in

D: the Brown Bear which only uses caves for hibernation. Being about 30% bigger

D: the steeper forehead of the cave bear. It was an omnivore, eating herbs, grass,
D: berries, but also honey and occasionally small animals.

D:[Gr. three-horn face], genus of ornithischian quadruped
D: dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous period. Because of some variations in
D: sample fossils, it was thought at one time that there were as many as 16
D: different species, but only one species, Triceratops horridus is currently
D: recognized. It is characterized by its three horns, one on the nose and one
D: over each eye, and a large bony frill projecting backward from the skull,
D: which probably served to protect the neck and fore part of the body. The
D: head was large (about 8 ft/2.4 m long), the body (about 20 ft/6 m long) was
D: bulky and barrel shaped, and the limbs were massive and of equal length.
D: Fossil specimens have been found in the W United States and Canada. It
D: belongs to the group of horned dinosaurs, the ceratopsians.

D:"... and at that moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor,
D: passes by the cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and
D: erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is
D: still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's
D: robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning the enemies
D: of the Roman Church -- at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old,
D: monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants
D: and slaves and the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd
D: and watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set
D: the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face
D: darkens. He knits his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a
D: sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him.
D: And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into
D: submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately
D: makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they
D: lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to
D: the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the
D: people in silence and passes on."
D: - Fyodor Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamasov"

D:"'The Moreau Horrors!' The phrase drifted loose in my

D: a little buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one
D: shiver and creep. . . .
D:   Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing
D: facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition
D: was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly
D: his career was closed. A journalist obtained
D: access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with
D: the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help
D: of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became
D: notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise
D: mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house. . . It was not the first time that
D: conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was
D: simply howled out of the country. . . .
D: Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly
D: cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his
D: investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would
D: who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was
D: unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider."
