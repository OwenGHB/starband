=== Magic FAQ ===
Q: I'm level 12, and I can't cast the level 12 spells in my device/
spellbook! What is going on?

A. Whether or not you can cast/understand a spell or effect is _solely_ 
determined by your level in the appropriate skill. Which for mage spells 
is Latin + Occult path, and for priest spells is Latin + Spirituality path. 
For devices - if you get them, it's gadgeteering + the specific device skill.
See the magic FAQ for more details.


Q:Come again?

A:There are a collection of skills for each type of magic that determine
which spells you can cast. You add all the relevant skills together and
if they are higher then the level of effect you are trying to cast then
you can produce it. We are calling this a 'chain'.


Q: I cast a spell, and took damage and had my stats drained! What the 
@$%& is this? I've been playing V for years - and magic should just
work! 

A: First - There is a way to use magic relatively safely. Second - 
this is a victorian / steam / pulp variant of Angband called Steamband. 
In all the Victorian literature that you have ever read, do you remember
there being any wizards? Those who did mess with magic, do you remember 
the stories they were in? You know, like H.P. Lovecraft? or perhaps John 
Dee from Guy Fawkes? Are these wizards? or mortals who have imperiled 
their mortal soul to traffick in dark magicks of the damned?


Q:That sucks! Why would I ever use magic?

A:If you're willing to overcome the difficulties, there are many powerful
spells available to the most powerful mages. Some of the new effects are
quite cool. They are surely worth checking out.


Q:Ok, spell it out for me buddy, how do I use magic.

A:Magic is complicated, but well worth the effort to learn. Below is an 
explanation. 

There are three (3) different kinds of magic
1)Will magic (or Occult)
2)Prayer magic (or Spirituality)
3)Enigmatic devices (or Gadgeteering)

Occult magic is the most dangerous, many spells have stat and hp costs
associated with them. 
Spirituality is safer, though upon failure there can be disastrous
consequences.
Gadgeteering is safest - there is no penalty to failing to cast a 
gadgeteering effect.

Each type of magic has certain skills associated with learning it and
casting it safely.


============
Gadgeteering
============
Q:Let's start in reverse order - tell me about Gadgeteering!

A:There are various enigmatic devices you may find in the game (such
as the utility bandoleer) which can produce certain effects. Some classes
have access to skills that match the name of these devices, if they put 
skill points into the skills that match the name of the devices they can
produce effects from them. Engineers and Gentlemen also have a skill called 
Gadgeteering which applies to all devices, and is added to the specific 
device skill allowing them to get more powerful effects. This type of magic 
is closest to the old *band style of play.

The skills that Gadgeteering uses are listed below
[Gadgeteer] - adds it skill value to all the devices below to determine
which effects you can generate.
[Utility Bandolier]
[Detectives Kit]
[Clockwork Chassis]
[Clockwork Carbine]
[Velocipede]
[Analytic Engine]

You take your skill in Gadgeteering and add it to the skill in the particular
device you are trying to use, and if that number is higher than the level
of the effect, you have a chance to use it. So your Gadgeteering chain is
[Gadgeteer]+[specific device] in determining what spells you can cast for
each device.
There are no penalties for failure or any negative effects for Gadgeteering.

============
Spirituality
============
Q:Well, that wasn't so hard. What about Spirituality or Prayer magic?

A:The Spirituality chain (the list of skills that determine what spells
you can cast) is [Latin] + [Spirituality]+-->[Prayer]+-->[Devotion]. 
The arrows are there because you don't start with prayer, you start with
spirituality and once that is high enough the prayer skill opens up.
You can use this chain with the Green books you find in the game.


Q:Wow, that looks much more powerful than gadgeteering! And lots of books
to cast spells out of than-

A:Not so fast. There are other factors involved in spirit magic. 
Although there is never a cost to casting a prayer, a wayward prayer
can have disastrous consequences. If you fail to cast a prayer and
the wrong power intercepts your message your character could be surrounded 
by demons or worse! So you must also practice your warding skills.
[Lesser Warding]+-->[Greater Warding] will protect you from negative
consequences if your prayers fail. You will gain access to [Lesser
Warding] after your first few skill points are spent on spirituality.

==============================
Willpower  & Other Information
==============================
Q:How do I tell which spells are safe to cast?

A:Dangerous spells are shown in violet, and risky ones in yellow. 
Relatively safe spells are shown in the color of the book.


Q:What's the deal with Willpower?

A:With Spirituality and Occult magic your Willpower score [Tempered
Will]+-->[Hardened Will]+-->[Iron Will] will increase the 
effectiveness of your spells. A spellcaster without willpower is 
a sorry sight indeed. Your willpower score does not affect spells
from engimatic devices.

=====================
Occult, or Will Magic
=====================
Q:Ok, what about Occult magic.

A:The Occult chain is [Latin] + [Occult]+-->[Advanced Occult]+-->
[Cthulhu Mythos]


Q:What's the catch?

A:There is nearly *always* a cost to using the powerful "Occult" 
or red book 'm'agic. Successfully casting spells can often damage 
your mind and body. To protect yourself you need [Thaumic Energy]+-->
[Advanced Thaumic Energy]. 


Q:How do I get access to [Thaumic Energy]?

A:It will unlock from increasing [Ritual Magic]. [Ritual Magic]
much like the willpower chain increases the power of your spells.
See, you need to have a background in ritual magic before you can
begin to use thaumic energy correctly.


Q:Wait! I cast a safe spell (one that was the color of the book - not
violet or yellow) and I still had my stats drained!

A: It's true. There is *always* a cost to using some occult spells.
However, if you are fully protected, your stat drain should have been
in the range of 1-3 points. Often allowing you to cast a spell dozens
of times before seeing any real negative effects from the stat loss.

Well, any costs besdies having to restore the stats. I hear they
sell some good tonics in town for that sort of thing.


Q:Hey! I inspected the first occult spellbook and in the description
it told me it was forbidden and would self-destruct after reading!

A:Well, I did say it was risky. :-) That's just flavor text, though
suppose if you tried to use the book without learning how to control
thaumic energy it might very quickly lead to your demise.


Q:Hey, it doesn't say anything about my spellcaster wearing gloves. . .

A:That's because there isn't a penalty for wearing gloves.


Q:Why does it let me wield spellbooks? 

A:Because if you're holding a spellbook in your hand, it's bonus (+x)
is a magic master bonus. It raises your [Latin] and your 'saftey' skills,
(both [Thaumic Energy] and [Lesser Warding]) making your spells more
safe and eaiser to cast.
