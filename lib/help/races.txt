 British
	Hailing from the grand isle of Britain, little can stop 
	their powerful imperialist drive. Stout and afraid of 
	nothing, the British expand throughout the world sharing 
	their superior way of life to those not fortunate enough 
	to be born under the rule of Queen Victoria. They are the 
	standard by which the rest of the world is judged. Growing
	up under the British culture you will find yourself well 
	prepared for whatever endeavors you may perchance to take. 
	Because of their faith in the unsurpassable power 
	of the British Empire and the belief of their culture's 
	supremacy, the British do not know fear.

***** <Asiatic>
 Asiatic
	Coming from the mystical eastern Asia, these people have 
	grown up in a very different culture from the Western point
	of view. Their emphasis on joint control of body and mind, 
	Ying and Yang, gives them a fantastic discipline. Eastern 
	culture has not given them a very good understanding of 
	science and also their manners might be considered odd by 
	westerners. They are also poor at disarming traps, and  
	using devices. Asiatic people have a limited mystical 
	ability to sense their immediate surroundings in dark.

 American
	Americans came from the young democratic republic of the 
	new continent. Their country is recovering from the 
	devastating civil war and adventurous spirits are high. 
	Americans aren't generally very strong on willpower or 
	mystical aspects, but they are personable and driven 
	in their own way. Americans are poor at disarming 
	traps, saving throws and stealth.

 African
	Africans, or Negroes as westerners call them, are used 
	to living in very harsh conditions of the darkest Africa. 
	Coming from the uncharted savage areas of the World they 
	are very strong, they have excellent endurance and agility, 
	but they lack the knowledge and manners brought by Western 
	education. Africans are poor at disarming traps, 
	using devices and stealth.

 French
	The French came from the great nation of France. They 
	speak one of the most refined languages, which is used 
	in many high societies in Europe - even in the Russian 
	Tsar's court! They still remember and admire the times 
	of the Louis XIV making them very charming in their 
	behaviour and manners. The French are poor at disarming 
	traps, using devices and stealth.
	
	The French get the skill of "Connoisseur" which allows
	them to make meals which restore some of their lost
	strength. The higher this skill, the more the meal heals
	the player.

 German
	The Germans are known for their industrious spirit and

	The Germans are poor at disarming traps, and stealth.
	
	The Germans get the skill Ransack and Plunder which

 Russian
	The vast Russian empire is perhaps the strongest 
	European power reaching from the Baltic and Barents Sea 
	to the Pacific Ocean and having twice the population of 
	any other European power. Living under the Tsar's absolute 
	rule, hot summers and cold winters are not easy, but the 
	Russians are used to it giving them good physical health. 
	Most of the Russian population, who unlike most other 
	Europeans follow the teachings of the Orthodox Church, are 
	illiterate peasants. The Russians are poor at using

	gives the Scandinavians better magical abilities, but 
	makes them a bit less charming and presentable. The 
	Scandinavians are poor at all skills.

	gives them Slow Digestion and some agility. The

 Dwarf
	Dwarves, industrious folks of the underground, are

	and mining huge and sophisticated tunnel networks 
	(some scientists say that the Earth is actually 
	hollow) make them very strong and healthy. 
	Their scientific achievements are much more advanced 
	than those of humans. Their short growth makes them 
	less agile and not so pleasant to look at. Dwarves are 
	good at disarming traps, but they are poor at the rest.

	Dwarves get access to the Stonelore skill which senses
	their surroundings underground, and eventually allows
	them to escape a level quickly. 
	
	Dwarves also start off with access to the Power Strike
	skill, and can specialize in axes regardless of class.

 Automaton
	Automata are mechanical men. They do not evolve 
	or develop in the same sense as living things, 
	but their fine constructed bodies give them 
	endurance and strength over that of humans. 
	They can also use different mechanical body 
	parts giving them new characteristics. Their 
	statistics cannot be reduced, their experience 
	cannot be drained (much) and they cannot be 
	poisoned. Automata themselves are poor at all 
	skills, but they can have some skills depending 
	of their designed use (i.e. class). Automata
	cannot drink tonics, must rely on mechanisms for
	healing, and eat oil instead of food. They cannot
	wear hats, boots, body armor or gloves, these items
	do not fit around their body forms. These slots are
	where automata heads, legs, torsos, and arms are equipped.
	
	Automata start with skill Utility Cypher, which 
	allows them to detect things, and eventually identify
	objects, and can get Systems Cypher later. 
	
	Automata also begin with access to the accurate strike
	skill, and the accurate shot skill due to their 
	mechanical precision.
