***** <Officer>
 Officer
	There are many opportunities for valour - one of the 
	quickest in the fast-paced mobile world of the 19th Century 
	was to enlist in the armed forces of your homeland. In addition 
	to a broad background in various fighting techniques and 
	hours of practice on the firing range, Officers learn the 
	ability of command and leadership. These skills allow them 
	to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, drive their 
	ranks into confusion, and even dominate them into following 
	orders. Officers have very good physical attributes and 
	uniform makes them look good as well. Senior officers are 
	known to be fearless.
	
	Officers gain some special skills from the Neophyte combat
	path.

***** <Aesthete>
 Aesthete
	Aesthetes are upper class connoisseurs of art who have 
	great eye for beauty and for, well, aesthetics. They are 
	masters in getting their money's worth since they know the 
	value of things. They are not physically very strong, but 
	they have had a profound education in science. Their eye 
	for beauty also applies to their clothing making them very 
	nice to look at.
	
	Aesthete's who speak Latin well can gain access to a skill
	that allows them to increase sale prices, and reduce buy prices,
	and stealthy Aesthete's can even bribe monsters in the dungeon!

***** <Engineer>
 Engineer
	Engineers are the hardy workers and experts in applied science. 
	They are at home with different devices and can activate them 
	for different effects. Their strength lies in these devices and 
	their use.
	They have gone through long schooling making them experts with 
	science and they have quite good willpower as well. Engineers 
	in general are not viewed as very attractive.

	Engineers specializing in Latin, searching, or disabling devices
	can often discover skills that increase their ability to cause
	critical damage to certain types of monsters.

***** <Medium>
 Medium
	Mediums act as middlemen between spiritual and our world. 
	Some of the so-called mediums are just swindlers who are after 
	your money, but there are some real ones, who can really connect 
	with the other world. They are very good in utilizing their 
	mental powers and exploiting the spiritual world.
	Mediums are not good in physical attributes, but they are very 
	strong in mental area.

	Mediums specializing in spirituality gain access to a variety 
	of special abilities, and mediums with strong willpower can 
	become very powerful.

***** <Adventurer>
 Adventurer
	Adventurers are in it for the thrill. They are not necessarily 
	after money, but it of course helps. Adventurers are the 
	all-around fighter type. Their physical attributes are better 
	than mental ones and they are certainly not the type which 
	stays indoors at school studying. Their fighting 
	skills are better than any other class.
	
	Adventurers specializing in search can learn to blaze trails
	in the dungeon, and even learn a variety of special abilities.
	Tough and stealthy adventurers can learn to resist many types of
	elements. Adventurers can also specialize in certain weapon types
	to a great degree, but choosing one eliminates your ability to 
	specialize in any of the others.

***** <Dashing Hussar>
 Dashing Hussar
	Hussars are the noble warriors of Poland. Many poor noble 
	men made astonishing careers as these flamboyant warriors. 
	They saved the city of Vienna, and thus the whole Austria - 
	from the Turkish siege in 1683. Their fighting tradition 
	goes back to the Middle Ages so they have had plenty of 
	time to master hand-to-hand combat. They continue to be a 
	fearsome opponent even at the time of firearms.
	They are unparalleled fighters, they have excellent 
	physical attributes and their noble upbringing gives them 
	good education.

	Dashing Hussars start with the skill 'Dragon's Heart' which
	increases the amount they gain from increasing their stats.
	Raising this early makes it more effective.

***** <Gentleman/Lady>
 Gentleman/Lady
	Gentlemen are a product of their time. They are good at 
	nothing, even in keeping their money, since they have a 
	tendency to lead an extravagant life they cannot afford. 
	They have neglected their physical exercises and are not 
	particularly well educated in science either. They are 
	the real challenge to play.

***** <Rogue>
 Rogue
	Rogues are professional thieves and cutpurses. They range 
	from a filthy street urchin to a sophisticated gentleman 
	burglar like Arsene Lupin. They all have common that they 
	are very agile and stealthy and they can use some 
	devices to aid them in their unsavoury endeavours.

	Stealthy Rogues gain a variety of special abilities, but if
	a rogue specializes in martial arts also eventually powerful
	ancient combat techniques become available. Rogues good at 
	disabling devices, or Latin can also learn to strike devastating
	critical blows.

***** <Naturalist>
 Naturalist
	The modern view of man as a master over nature has some 
	opponents. These naturalists claim that humans are dependant 
	on nature and they want to preserve the nature from being 
	destroyed and polluted by modern machinery and advances. 
	They are very tuned-in with nature. Due to their 
	well-planned diet they are healthy, though not otherwise 
	physically fit. Their best strengths lie in their knowledge 
	of mystical aspects of nature.
	
	Naturalists can align themselves with various elements giving
	them a variety of special abilities. Aligning yourself with one
	of the elements eliminates your ability to access any of the 
	other lore skills.
