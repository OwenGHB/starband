=== Wound Point FAQ ===
Q:What's WP?

A:Wound points.


Q:Oh. What exactly are they?

A:Each character has wound points, representing his actual physical health.
When the character reaches below 0 wound points he dies. 


Q:Oh, then what's HP?

A:Hit points.


Q:Well if Wound points are actual physical health, what are HP? what
do they do?

A:Each character has hit points, representing the general condition of the 
character and how well he is able to resist taking damage. They basically
act as ablative shielding for wound points.


Q:I keep getting messages that my Wounds Ache.

A:Yes, when you are wounded, often your condition will worsen. Nothing
negative will happen to you while 'R'esting. Bad things may start to happen
when you've lost about 40% of your total wound points + hit points. You
can always rest to keep your hit points at maximum, but if you're down to
20% of your remaining wound points your hit points being at max won't help
much. That's some pretty serious injury.


Q:My wound points won't heal!

A:They don't naturally regenerate. Once you gain some regenerative powers
they will start to (slowly) regenerate while in the dungeon. They will
quickly regenerate while you are in town. You can also heal them by 
drinking potions.


Q:I notice HP's are not shown on dumps. Why?

A:Well, since Hit points can be refilled at a moments notice, this fairly
transitory value seemed much less important to include on dumps then the
much more important WP value.


Q:If you get to zero HP's does further damage debit your WP or just kill you?

A:If you have no HP's, there is no chance of them stopping any of the 
WP damage. In addition you take another 2-4 WP's of damage in addition
to what you would have taken.
