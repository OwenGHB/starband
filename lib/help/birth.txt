============================
=== Creating a Character ===
============================

Welcome to character creation! Would you like to be a British Officer,
an Asiatic Medium, or perhaps even an Automaton Rogue!

You'll have to name your new adventurer, otherwise deeds of his records
could not be kept.

Pressing the Question mark ('?') on a race or class during character 
creation will give you detailed information on that choice.

=================================
=== Character Characteristics ===
=================================

Steamband is a skill based variant. Be sure to review the FAQ if you're 
familiar with Angband and other variants.

You select your gender, race, and class. These determine the skills you
have avaiable upon creation, which skills you can unlock, your innate
powers, your  inborn natural statistics, and a great many other things 
besides.

Each character has a few secondary attributes (height, weight, social
class, and background history) of which social class is the most important.
The extra money the rich and privledged have give a big advantage to 
starting characters. In fact, compared with the inital variance in starting
inborn natural statistics, social class has a much larger impact on an 
early character's survival. This is really the only random factor which 
matters in character creation. It determines the value of the starting
equipment as well as how much money you have to purchase more. The better
outfitted you are on your first trip into the depths the better off you 
will be.

Each character also has six primary statistics or "stats", Muscle (MUS),
Agility (AGI), Vigor (VIG), Schooling (SCH), Ego (EGO), and Charm (CHR), 
which modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  Each 
stat has a numerical value from 1 to 999. The value is limited to 700 for
intrinsic value (i.e., not counting equipment bonuses). Equipment bonuses
and penalties may modify the score, including raising it above 700. 
Calculation of statistics is discussed below.

========================
== A Matter of Skills ==
========================

Each character also has a large selection of "skills", including [Disarming
Traps], [Using Devices], [Stealth], [Searching], [Neophyte Combat], 
[Neophyte Firearms], and [Latin]. Which skills you start with are derived 
from the character's race & class.  

To access the skills screen from within the game hit the 'G' key ('G') to 
'G'ain skills. To find out information about these skills hit the Question 
mark key ('?') while the skill is selected on the skills screen. What 
skills eventually become available to a character is determined by his/her
class and how you choose to allocate that character's skill points. You may
allocate skill points when starting a character and any time the character
gains any skill points or stat gains. A small indicator "(G) lv" will be
shown on the main screen in the lower right hand corner when you have
points to distribute.

By raising certain skills to certain levels, new skills become available.
These skills are often more specific than the skill that made them
available and often give the character access to more powers and abilities. 
All skills are limited to a maximum value of 3 + 1 for every level you gain 
while the skill has been available. Thus, it is in your best interests to 
open up skills as soon as possible. The maximum level of all skills is 20.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character.  These skills are increased the same way as 
normal skills and may be used by pressing the U key ('U') to use racial 
abilities. Sometimes your race may give you early access to a skill you 
could not otherwise get at the start.

Certain races may also have intrinsic abilities such as the ability to 
sustaina statistic such as muscle (e.g. sustain muscle), infravision, or 
even the ability to pass through walls. These do not require skill points 
added to them to function, though some of them may be made more effective 
by the allocation of skill points to improve them. As a special note, 
statistic sustains do not affect drain from spellcasting.

===============================================
== A Primer on Self-Improvement (Experience) ==
===============================================

Each character has experience, which increases as the character kills 
monsters 'q'uaffs unidentified tonics, uses unidentified items, or a few 
other actions.

Each character also has a level, based on experience, race and class.  
As the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level  rises, 
certain other abilities rise, and you gain more skill points to distribute 
as well as statistic gain points which raise all your statistics. Again, 
these can be distributed by using the 'G' key. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: unlike other Angband variants very little depends on your
level -- most increases in power come from your allocation of skill points.

By default the display for experience shows how many points you need to 
gain to reach your next level.

=========================================
== A Bit on the Value of Goods (Money) ==
=========================================

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it hidden in
the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold. Gold has no weight.
The amount of gold you start with is determined by your social class.
  
Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be kept, 
or sold to a shopkeeper for more gold. However, especially valuable items
will never sell for the full price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that 
he is prepared to pay for any item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy 
your items for up to 30,000 gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and 
will pay no more than 5,000.

========================================
== Vigerous Exercises (AC, HP/WP, SP) ==
========================================

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by agility and the equipped 
items. Armor class on equipment is always denoted in [square brackets], 
usually as a figure of [X,+Y] where X is the intrinsic AC of the armor in 
question, and +Y is the magical bonus to armor class provided by that item. 
Armor class both affects wether or not you get hit, and also reduces 
damage.

Each character has hit points, representing the general condition of the 
character and how well he is able to resist taking damage.  The maximum 
number of hit points is derived from your race, class, level, and vigor, 
and you can never have more hit points than the maximum.  Hit points may be 
regained by resting, or by a variety of magical means.

Each character has wound points, representing his actual physical health.
When the character reaches below 0 wound points he dies. The maximum number 
of wound points is a combination of vigor, character level, and various 
skills. Wound points may be regained by resting if you are in the town or 
have the innate ability to regenerate. If not, they will not heal while in 
the dungeon. You can also regain wound points through various spells and 
tonics.

Each character has spell points, which represents how many spells,
prayers, or abilities a character can use.  The maximum number of spell
points is derived from a statistic (the specific statistic is based on your 
class), and your level. You can never have more spell points than the 
maximum.  Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means. You 
can determine which statistic your spellpoints are based off of because it 
is highlighted in light blue during the character creation process.

==============
=== Skills ===
==============

Skills are a *crucial* part of Steamband. The number one problem most
new players face is understanding the Steamband skill system. In 
Steamband, the level of your character is almost irrelevant in 
determining what your character can do -- all of your character's 
abilities are based off of her skills. Please take a minute below 
to review the skills system before playing Steamband for the first 
time.

You can gain access to the skills screen by pushing the G key ('G') 
anytime you are in town or in the dungeon. You can hop between 
the three skill 'groupings' by pushing the h key ('h'). You can navigate
around the list by pushing either the up arrow/'8' key ('8') or the down 
arrow/'2' key ('2'). You can increase your skills by pushing the '+' 
key ('+'). Skill increases are permanent -- once a point is added to a 
skill, it can never be removed. You may press the 'g' key while on the 
skills screen to "spend" your stat gain points to raise all of your stats 
once.

Again, for easy reference: 
You can gain access to the skills screen by pushing the 'G' key ('G') 
anytime you are in town or in the dungeon.

You can tell when you have available skill points to spend because in the 
lower right hand corner of the main screen there will be a green indicator 
when you have statgains or skill points left that says '(G) lv'

Each skill has a maximum value of 3 + 1 for every level you gain 
while the skill is available or 20, whichever is less. Thus, it 
is to your advantage to gain access to skills as soon as possible.

Sometimes when you raise a skill, new skills become available. For 
example, if you are playing a Rogue when your [Stealth] skill becomes 
15, you will gain access to a new skill called [Theft]. It will 
suddenly appear on the screen with a value of one. The maximum 
for this new skill is three. If you gain a level, that skill's 
maximum now becomes four. 

When the [Theft] skill reaches 20, you will gain access to the 
skill [Master Theft], which will appear on the screen just as 
theft did with a value of one, and a maximum of three. Just as 
with the [Theft] skill, when you gain a level the maximum of 
[Master Theft] increases by one. Note that even when you gain 
this level, you could not increase the original [Theft] skill 
because the maximum value for any and all skills is 20.

Note that the skill that opens up ([Theft]) does not necessarily 
affect the  original skill, i.e. raising [Theft] does *not* 
affect your [Stealth], it gives you a totally new ability.

To take another example, when [Neophyte Combat] reaches 5, a 
new skill opens up called [Standard Combat]. If you wished, 
you could never again put a point into [Neophyte Combat], 
and over time as you gained enough levels (17 more levels) 
you could raise [Standard Combat] all the way to 20 while leaving
[Neophyte Combat] at 5.

In this case, where both skills affect the same thing, how do 
you decide what skill to increase? Well, it's a matter of personal 
choice. In the example above, [Neophyte Combat] has more of an 
effect, and increases *both* your hand-to-hand and weapon combat, 
but [Standard Combat] opens up new skills.

Skills are *never* detrimental to other skills, i.e. you can have 
maxed combat and spellcasting and they would not affect each other 
negatively.

There is a description of each skill printed at the bottom of the 
screen when it is selected. You may press the Question mark key ('?') 
to get more information about your skills.

The skills you start with, and what skills you can gain access 
to is determined by both your race and class.

Sometimes special abilities are given via skills, or due to race. 
You can 'U'se the special abilities by pushing the 'U' key while 
in town or in the dungeon.

Sometimes when you put points into a skill, you may notice some 
other skills disappearing. This is true of weapon specialization 
for instance. Basically this is a group of skills, of which you 
can only have one. You should *never* lose a skill that you have 
already put points into, if you do, it is a bug and you should 
contact valis@oook.cz with a bug report. i.e. if you put a point
into [Rifles], making it 2, your access to [Pistols] and [Shotguns] 
should vanish.

Specific skill 'Trees' (a base skill that opens up many other skills) 
are found below. Certain race and class combinations may not gain 
access to all the skills in the tree. Hit Question mark ('?') on the skill
or see http://angband.oook.cz/steamband/steamband.html for spoilers.
 
Melee Fighting
	Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons. The
	base skill in this tree is [Neophyte Combat]. Upon reaching 5,
	[Standard Combat] becomes available which allows access to the
	rest of the skills in the tree. Each progressive 'combat' skill
	(i.e. [Advanced Combat], [Master Combat]) provides less and less
	of an increase in your combat skill (though all additions are 
	cumulative). Taking the [Standard Combat] Skill to 10 gives you
	access to the [Toughness]->[Fortitude]->[Iron Body] chain of skills
	which increase your wound points. [Vicious Strike] and [Accurate
	Strike] increase your + to hit and damage. [Advanced Combat] is 
	necessary to access [Power Strike] (increases the force of your blows)
	and [Critical Strike] (increases the power and frequency of your
	criticals.)

Martial Arts
	Martial arts is the ability to hit and do damage when you are 
	not wielding *anything* in your hands. Each successive blow you
	strike in sequence with martial arts does more damage, and the
	higher your skill in the main path, the more often you will 
	strike devastating criticals. Several special skills open up 
	off of this path including [The Gentle Way] which allows 
	counter-attacks when you are struck. As with the melee weapons 
	tree, earlier skills are more effective but later skills open 
	up new skills.
 
Firearms
	Firearms is your ability to hit and do damage with guns. If 
	you are using a shotgun and buckshot, you don't have to hit 
	the monsters (it fires an arc of buckshot) so you can bypass 
	putting points into this skill if you wish. As with the melee 
	weapons, earlier skills are more effective, but later skills 
	open up new skills. (e.g. you must have [Master Firearms] to 
	access [Swift Shot] which decreases the amount of time it takes
	to reload your firearm.)
 
Throwing
	Throwing is your ability to hit and do damage with any object 
	you can throw. It goes very well with martial arts, since you 
	you can throw items much faster if nothing is wielded in your 
	hands. It can be a very fast and powerful damage dealer. You
	may throw dangerous tonics to damage monsters.

Devices
	Devices is your ability to successfully activate ray guns, 
	tools, and artifacts. As you raise your device skill you 
	get access to powers that increase the damage and effect 
	of the items you use, as well as being able to use these 
	devices much faster than normal. Do not overlook this skill, 
	for it is quite possible to cause *huge* amounts of damage 
	with nothing but ray guns alone if you invest the time in 
	[Device Power Amp] and [Advanced Power Amp]. And if you 
	raise your [Fast Device Use] you can pump out a lot of 
	that damage every turn. It is *very* safe to recharge
	devices using power cells, and for just a couple thousand 
	gold and some points here, you can devastate the dungeon 
	and its inhabitants around you.

Prayer Magic (Spirituality)
	This is is a collection of skills that affect your ability 
	to use 'Divine' or green book 'm'agic. The [Spirituality] 
	chain ([Latin] + [Spirituality]-->[Prayer]-->[Devotion]) determines 
	what 'level' of prayer you can cast from a green book.
	Prayers can be *very* dangerous if they fail, so [Spirituality] 
	gives you access to [Lesser Warding] which gives you access 
	to [Greater Warding]. These warding skills can *greatly* 
	increase the safety of your prayers. Dangerous prayers are 
	shown in violet, and risky ones in yellow. Safe prayers
	are shown in the color of the book. 
	
Will Magic (Occult)
	There is nearly *always* a cost to using the powerful 'Arcane' 
	or red book 'm'agic. Successfully casting spells can often 
	damage your mind and body. But the eventual power these books 
	let you wield include the ability to find out everything about 
	powerful objects, remove yourself from sight, move to the spot
	of your choosing, infuse your body with powerful demonic combat 
	abilities, and even to cannibalize your own flesh for spiritual 
	strength.
	
	The 'Occult' chain ([Latin] + [Occult]-->[Advanced Occult]-->
	[Cthulhu Mythos]) determines the 'level' of the spell you can cast 
	from a red book. Spells can be *very* dangerous, so [Ritual Magic] 
	which increases the power of your spells, gives you access to 
	[Thaumic Energy] which gives you access to [Advanced Thaumic Energy]. 
	These Thaumic energy skills can *greatly* increase the safety of 
	your spells, though they can never remove the cost from many of 
	them completely. Dangerous spells are shown in violet, and risky 
	ones in yellow. Relatively safe spells are shown in the color of 
	the book.

Willpower
	The willpower skills greatly boost the power of both Prayers and 
	Will magic. It is also useful in a variety of other ways, sometimes 
	providing access to skills, and sometimes affecting your ability 
	to use certain attacks (e.g. mental attacks, or charm effects).
	
Enigmatic Device skills and Gadgeteering
	Certain powerful devices have the ability to create a variety 
	of effects. If you have [Gadgeteering] you can use any of these, 
	or if you have the specific device skill, you can use that device. 
	[Gadgeteering] is added to the specific device skill to determine 
	which of these effects you can cast. Enigmatic devices are always 
	safe to use, the only danger is that sometimes you may fail to 
	produce the desired effect. Enigmatic devices are such things
	as the [Utility Bandoleer] or the [Clockwork Carbine].
	
Miscellaneous
	Each of these skills has no tree of its own, but depending 
	on your class may open up a variety of useful abilities. 
	
	Latin: Increases the amount of 'm'agic you can use, can also 
	open up skills depending on knowledge, such as [Anatomy] 
	(cause criticals) or [Art Appreciation] (raise sale price/lower 
	buy price) based off your class.
	
	Search: Allows you to discover traps and items hidden in the 
	dungeon. Always allows access to the [Keen Eyes] skill which 
	increases the range of your guns by one for every 4 points.
	
	Disarm Traps: Allows you to disarm traps. Can also give access 
	to skills such as [Disable Construct] depending on class.
	
	Stealth: Allows you to avoid waking monsters up and reduces 
	the amount of noise you make. Can open up a variety of special 
	skills depending on your class.


=== Races === 

Descriptions were provided by Janne "Giants" Keskinarkaus

There are twenty-five different races that you can choose from in Steamband.  
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. 
Most races also have intrinsic abilities. Specific racial skills are 'U'sed
with the 'U' key.
 
 British
	Hailing from the grand isle of Britain, little can stop 
	their powerful imperialist drive. Stout and afraid of 
	nothing, the British expand throughout the world sharing 
	their superior way of life to those not fortunate enough 
	to be born under the rule of Queen Victoria. They are the 
	standard by which the rest of the world is judged. Growing
	up under the British culture you will find yourself well 
	prepared for whatever endeavors you may perchance to take. 
	Because of their faith in the unsurpassable power 
	of the British Empire and the belief of their culture's 
	supremacy, the British do not know fear.

 Asiatic
	Coming from the mystical eastern Asia, these people have 
	grown up in a very different culture from the Western point
	of view. Their emphasis on joint control of body and mind, 
	Ying and Yang, gives them a fantastic discipline. Eastern 
	culture has not given them a very good understanding of 
	science and also their manners might be considered odd by 
	westerners. They are also poor at disarming traps, and  
	using devices. Asiatic people have a limited mystical 
	ability to sense their immediate surroundings in dark.

	Americans came from the young democratic republic of the 
	new continent. Their country is recovering from the 
	devastating civil war and adventurous spirits are high. 
	Americans aren't generally very strong on willpower or 
	mystical aspects, but they are personable and driven 
	in their own way. Americans are poor at disarming 
	traps, saving throws and stealth.

 African
	Africans, or Negroes as westerners call them, are used 
	to living in very harsh conditions of the darkest Africa. 
	Coming from the uncharted savage areas of the World they 
	are very strong, they have excellent endurance and agility, 
	but they lack the knowledge and manners brought by Western 
	education. Africans are poor at disarming traps, 
	using devices and stealth.

 French
	The French came from the great nation of France. They 
	speak one of the most refined languages, which is used 
	in many high societies in Europe - even in the Russian 
	Tsar's court! They still remember and admire the times 
	of the Louie XIV making them very charming in their 
	behaviour and manners. The French are poor at disarming 
	traps, using devices and stealth.
	
	The French get the skill of "Connoisseur" which allows
	them to make meals which restore some of their lost
	strength. The higher this skill, the more the meal heals
	the player.

	neglect their physical exercises, namely agility.

	disciplines gives them some physical strength. The 
	Germans are also very self-knowledgeable and strong 
	on will, which gives them an edge with mystical aspects. 
	The Germans are poor at disarming traps, and stealth.
	
	The Germans get the skill Ransack and Plunder which 
	allows them to detect valuable objects and eventually
	turn any item they find into gold.

	to the Pacific Ocean and having twice the population of 
	any other European power. Living under the Tsar's absolute 
	rule, hot summers and cold winters are not easy, but the 
	Russians are used to it giving them good physical health. 
	Most of the Russian population, who unlike most other 
	Europeans follow the teachings of the Orthodox Church, are 
	illiterate peasants. The Russians are poor at using

	Rome when Europe fell to the dark Middle Ages. Their 
	mystical culture gives them better understanding of 
	magic and living in dry desert areas of the world 
	gives them Slow Digestion and some agility. The

	(some scientists say that the Earth is actually 
	hollow) make them very strong and healthy. 
	Their scientific achievements are much more advanced 
	than those of humans. Their short growth makes them 
	less agile and not so pleasant to look at. Dwarves are 
	good at disarming traps, but they are poor at the rest.

	Dwarves get access to the Stonelore skill which senses
	their surroundings underground, and eventually allows
	them to escape a level quickly. 
	
	Dwarves also start off with access to the Power Strike
	skill, and can specialize in axes regardless of class.

	Unseelie Fae or Unseelie Court, are the evil and

	They are not very bright, and if you realize that 
	such fairy is tormenting you, you can usually 
	fairly easily out-smart it. They are generally 
	best at physical efforts being even stronger than 
	dwarves. They can see invisible beings, and their 
	magical abilities allow them to float preventing
	them from falling. They also gain strange mutations
	over time. Unseelie Fae are good at saving throw
	and stealth.

 Automaton
	Automata are mechanical men. They do not evolve 
	or develop in the same sense as living things, 
	but their fine constructed bodies give them 
	endurance and strength over that of humans. 
	They can also use different mechanical body 
	parts giving them new characteristics. Their 
	statistics cannot be reduced, their experience 
	cannot be drained (much) and they cannot be 
	poisoned. Automata themselves are poor at all 
	skills, but they can have some skills depending 
	of their designed use (i.e. class). Automata
	cannot drink tonics, must rely on mechanisms for
	healing, and eat oil instead of food. They cannot
	wear hats, boots, body armor or gloves, these items
	do not fit around their body forms. These slots are
	where automata heads, legs, torsos, and arms are equipped.
	
	Automata start with skill Utility Cypher, which 
	allows them to detect things, and eventually identify
	objects, and can get Systems Cypher later. 
	
	Automata also begin with access to the accurate strike
	skill, and the accurate shot skill due to their 
	mechanical precision.

	soon be other 'upgrade' options for automata - they 
	will have a slightly modified way of gaining stats.)
               
 Steam-Mecha
	Steam-mecha are great and powerful war machines. 
	They are bigger, harder and meaner than automata 
	making them truly horrible fighting monstrosities. 
	These steam-powered machines are very, very difficult 
	not to notice as they hum, clack, rattle and blow 
	steam as they make their way through the dungeon. 
	This noise will alarm any monster from a distance. 
	They can use mechanical body parts just as automata 
	and their statistics cannot be reduced, their 
	experience cannot be drained and they cannot be 
	poisoned. Steam mecha are poor at all skills. 
	
	Steam-Mecha start with the Onslaught Cypher skill, which
	enhances their weaponry and get Aegis Cypher and Systems
	Cypher later.
	
	Steam-Mecha also begin with access to the accurate
	and vicious strike skills, along with access to the
	accurate and vicious shot skills due to their construction
	for war.

	aspects and science, but are also superior to

	much stronger and agile than ordinary humans 
	although their hands are mirrored from human 
	point of view, their thumbs being inside when 
	their palms are up. They are also very beautiful 
	and have some knowledge in science. They have 
	their agility sustained. The Rakshasa may gain
	strange mutations. Rakshasa are good at using 
	devices, and stealth. They are poor
	at disarming traps. 
	
	Rakshasa have the Demonic Attunement skill, which allows 
	them to mystify and charm opponents and they also 
	get Dark Charm early on.
	
	Rakshasa also start with access to the weapon

	it hurts them.  Ghosts also float through air making them
	unable to fall and they are telepathic, being able to sense
	other intelligent beings nearby. The draw side of spirit form
	is that their ability to operate physically is limited. 
	Ghosts are very agile and very good at magic. 
	They are good at stealth but poor at disarming

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. An easy class
to begin with is adventurer. Spellcasting classes are for more experienced
players familiar with survival techniques.
 
 Officer
	There are many opportunities for valour - one of the 
	quickest in the fast-paced mobile world of the 19th Century 
	was to enlist in the armed forces of your homeland. In addition 
	to a broad background in various fighting techniques and 
	hours of practice on the firing range, Officers learn the 
	ability of command and leadership. These skills allow them 
	to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, drive their 
	ranks into confusion, and even dominate them into following 
	orders. Officers have very good physical attributes and 
	uniform makes them look good as well. Senior officers are 
	known to be fearless.
	
	Officers gain some special skills from the Neophyte combat
	path.

 Aesthete
	Aesthetes are upper class connoisseurs of art who have 
	great eye for beauty and for, well, aesthetics. They are 
	masters in getting their money's worth since they know the 
	value of things. They are not physically very strong, but 
	they have had a profound education in science. Their eye 
	for beauty also applies to their clothing making them very 
	nice to look at.
	
	Aesthetes who speak Latin well can gain access to a skill
	that allows them to increase sale prices, and reduce buy prices,
	and stealthy Aesthete's can even bribe monsters in the dungeon!

 Engineer
	Engineers are the hardy workers and experts in applied science. 
	They are at home with different devices and can activate them 
	for different effects. Their strength lies in these devices and 
	their use.
	They have gone through long schooling making them experts with 
	science and they have quite good willpower as well. Engineers 
	in general are not viewed as very attractive.

	Engineers specializing in Latin, searching, or disabling devices
	can often discover skills that increase their ability to cause
	critical damage to certain types of monsters.

 Medium
	Mediums act as middlemen between spiritual and our world. 
	Some of the so-called mediums are just swindlers who are after 
	your money, but there are some real ones, who can really connect 
	with the other world. They are very good in utilizing their 
	mental powers and exploiting the spiritual world.
	Mediums are not good in physical attributes, but they are very 
	strong in mental area.

	Mediums specializing in spirituality gain access to a variety 
	of special abilities, and mediums with strong willpower can 
	become very powerful.

 Adventurer
	Adventurers are in it for the thrill. They are not necessarily 
	after money, but it of course helps. Adventurers are the 
	all-around fighter type. Their physical attributes are better 
	than mental ones and they are certainly not the type which 
	stays indoors at school studying. Their fighting 
	skills are better than any other class.
	
	Adventurers specializing in search can learn to blaze trails
	in the dungeon, and even learn a variety of special abilities.
	Tough and stealthy adventurers can learn to resist many types of
	elements. Adventurers can also specialize in certain weapon types
	to a great degree, but choosing one eliminates your ability to 
	specialize in any of the others.

 Dashing Hussar
	Hussars are the noble warriors of Poland. Many poor noble 
	men made astonishing careers as these flamboyant warriors. 
	They saved the city of Vienna, and thus the whole Austria - 
	from the Turkish siege in 1683. Their fighting tradition 
	goes back to the Middle Ages so they have had plenty of 
	time to master hand-to-hand combat. They continue to be a 
	fearsome opponent even at the time of firearms.
	They are unparalleled fighters, they have excellent 
	physical attributes and their noble upbringing gives them 
	good education.

	Dashing Hussars start with the skill 'Dragon's Heart' which
	increases the amount they gain from increasing their stats.
	Raising this early makes it more effective.

	particularly well educated in science either. They are

	are very agile and stealthy and they can use some 
	devices to aid them in their unsavoury endeavours.

	Stealthy Rogues gain a variety of special abilities, but if
	a rogue specializes in martial arts also eventually powerful
	ancient combat techniques become available. Rogues good at 
	disabling devices, or Latin can also learn to strike devastating
	critical blows.

 Naturalist
	The modern view of man as a master over nature has some 
	opponents. These naturalists claim that humans are dependant 
	on nature and they want to preserve the nature from being 
	destroyed and polluted by modern machinery and advances. 
	They are very tuned-in with nature. Due to their 
	well-planned diet they are healthy, though not otherwise 
	physically fit. Their best strengths lie in their knowledge 
	of mystical aspects of nature.
	
	Naturalists can align themselves with various elements giving
	them a variety of special abilities. Aligning yourself with one
	of the elements eliminates your ability to access any of the 
	other lore skills.

=== Stats ===

All characters have two values that are used in determining stats.  The
first is the racial stat adjustment, and the second is the class stat 
adjustment. These are listed above under each description of race and 
class. These two values are added together, and you gain a random amount
to each stat from one to this value every time you increase a stat. There
are also certain skills that can raise the amount of this increase. Even
if your stats are drained, and you get an increase to the stats, the increase
applies to the undrained level of the stat.

When you gain levels, you will also gain between 0-3 'stat gain' points. 
Usually you will only gain one. On the skills screen ('G' to access) you
can 'spend' these stat gain points and all of your stats will increase
by their race + class adjustment.

Note: Those players familiar with 'maximise mode' will find in Steamband
that it does not apply. Because there are no "bonuses" to stats as
such, there is no need to determine if they are applied to the base
stat, or the final stat. All bonuses from items are applied to the base
stat, and all characters have a maximum internal stat of 700.

 Muscle
	Muscle is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
	combat.  A high muscle can improve your chances of hitting
	as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
	acters with low muscle may receive penalties.  Muscle
	is also useful in tunnelling and in carrying heavy items.
 
 Agility
	Agility is a combination of dexterity and quickness.  A high
	Agility may allow a character to get multiple blows with
	lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his killing power, and
	will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
	dodging blows from enemies.  Agility is also useful in
	picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
	some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if 
	the character has a high enough Agility, thieves will
	never be successful in stealing from the player.
 
 Vigor
	Vigor is a character's ability to resist damage to his
	body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
	character with a high Vigor will receive more hit
	points and also recover them faster while resting. Your
	Vigor, depending on your race, also will increase the number
	of wound points you have available.
 
 Schooling
	Schooling affects the abilities of characters using enigmatic
	devices, and has some effect on divine spellcasting.
	A high schooling may also improve your chances of successfully 
	using an enigmatic device or casting a divine spell. A good 
	schooling can also help with using magic devices, picking 
	locks, and disarming traps.
 
 Ego
	The primary function of Ego is to determine the force
	of will.  A high Ego will improve your chance of successfully
	using an arcane spell, and will also increase your chances
	of casting a divine spell to a lesser degree. A good Ego can also
	help to improve your chances of resisting magical spells cast
	upon you by monsters.
 
 Charm
	Charm represents a character's personality and physical
	appearance.  A character with a high Charm will receive
	better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
	very low Charm may be robbed blind. 
 
======================================
=== Combinations of Race and Class ===
======================================

Interesting classes to try are a Giant or Troll Adventurer, or 
a Ghost Medium. There are many examples of British Gentlemen, 
or perhaps an American Rogue is more to your liking.
